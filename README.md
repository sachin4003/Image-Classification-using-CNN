# Image-Classification-using-CNN
In this project, I successfully implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, utilizing the TensorFlow library. I opted for a CNN architecture, acknowledging its superior capabilities in handling image data due to its specialized convolutional layers.
The primary objective was to classify images into two distinct categories: "glasses" and "no glasses", based on a dataset provided.
Given the limited dataset size, I employed the ImageDataGenerator for comprehensive image augmentation. This technique generated augmented data samples by applying various transformations, ensuring robust model training.
~FINDINGS:-
-> The implementation of image augmentation played a pivotal role in mitigating data scarcity issues, 
 leading to a more robust and reliable model.
-> The CNN architecture, empowered by TensorFlow, significantly enhanced the model's ability to 
 distinguish between "glasses" and "no glasses" images.
